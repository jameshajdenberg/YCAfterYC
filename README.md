From 2021-2022, I spent a year in Israel on a program called Year Course (or YC).
By far the most meaningful part of the experience was the connections I made with each of the people on the program with me.
Realizing how many times I'd be seeing everyone post-YC, I decided to make a few vizualisations detailing when, why, how, and where I'd seen them.
Feel free to take a look!

This project includes vizualisations like a bar chart of encounters, a heatmap of meetings by date,
a pie chart for reasons of meetings, a box plot for distribution of meeting numbers, and a map of where I've seen everyone.
More visualizations will come as I learn more in my academic career.
